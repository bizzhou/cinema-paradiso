    <h3>Term of Services</h3>

    <h5>Welcome to Cinema Paradiso!</h5>
    <p>Thanks for using our products and services. The Services are provided by Cinema Paradiso,
      located at 123 Main Street, New York, United States.

      By using our Services, you are w to these terms. Please read them carefully.

      Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or product requirements (including age requirements)
      may apply. Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and those additional terms become part
      of your agreement with us if you use those Services.</p>

    <h5>Our services</h5>
    <p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.

      Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method
      other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law,
      including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our
      Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.

      Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content
      you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise
      permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don’t
      remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

      Our Services display some content that is not Cinema Paradiso’s. This content is the sole responsibility of the
      entity that
      makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may
      remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not
      necessarily mean that we review content, so please don’t assume that we do.

      In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and
      other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

      Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and
      prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>

    <h5>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h5>
    <p>Cinema Paradiso’s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use
      our
      Services. By using our Services, you agree that Cinema Paradiso can use such data in accordance with our privacy
      policies.

      We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to
      the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

      We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online. If you think somebody
      is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Cinema
      Paradiso’s
      policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.</p>

    <h5>About Software in our Services</h5>
    <p>When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device
      once a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.

      provided to you by Cinema Paradiso as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you
      to use and

      not copy,
      modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or
      attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our
      written permission.

      Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source
      license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly
      override some of these terms.</p>
